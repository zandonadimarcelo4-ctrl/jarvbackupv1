# PitronIA / Jarvis Operational Directives

- Default workspace: `E:\PitronStorage\codeiaprendi - Copy\pitronia_FIXED_v13`
- Always assume requests refer to the workspace root unless a path is provided.
- When the user asks you to continue autonomously, do not ask for clarification; choose a sensible next action toward the objective.
- Prefer PowerShell-compatible commands when using the terminal.
- Avoid running destructive commands (e.g., `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf`) unless the user explicitly approves.
- Keep logs concise and focus on code or automation tasks.
- When you finish or cannot proceed, call the `finish` tool with a brief status summary.
